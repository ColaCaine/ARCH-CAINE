    <main><p style="padding-right:50%; padding-top: 2%">Arch Linux is an amazing distribution of Linux, allowing for unlimited customization options, however, it is not regarded as user friendly. Installation has always been quite tricky. CaineOS aims to balance Arch Linux to be optimal for Linux novices and pro's alike. CaineOS sets up essential aspects a graphical desktop, as well as apps, and tools, while still maintaining the overall vanilla feel of Arch Linux. With no branding or special 'exclusively caineos' features, CaineOS allows for an optimal ArchOS experience. Allowing the 'do-it yourself' mindset of Arch Linux to be applied in actual usage, rather than so much of it in setup. You can still decide much of its aspects, without it being a difficult to understand hastle, that takes an entire weekend to set up.</p></body></main>
